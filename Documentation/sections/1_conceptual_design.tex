\section{Level of abstraction}
For \textbf{customer information}, we consider \textit{name}, \textit{surname}, and \textit{date of birth} for individual customers, and \textit{company name} and \textit{address} for business customers, where the address consists of \textit{street}, \textit{civic number}, \textit{city}, \textit{province}, \textit{region}, and \textit{state}.  

For \textbf{contact details}, we consider \textit{phone number} and \textit{email}.  

\textbf{Specialized personnel} is replaced by \textit{employees}.  

\textbf{Number of members} is replaced by \textit{number of employees}.  

\textbf{Number of operations} is replaced by \textit{number of orders}.
